<h2>CheekSqueak</h2>

A simple mod for Lethal Company which allows players to fart on command with a press of a button.
This mod is server-sided meaning your farts can be heard by other players in the same server as you and you can hear other players' fart.

Default button is F, but it can be changed by modifying CheekSqueak's config file ("../BepInEx/config/CheekSqueak.cfg").

**Note:** This mod requires you to have BepInEx installed.
