<h2>CheekSqueak</h2>

A simple mod for Lethal Company which allows players to fart on command with a press of a button. Farts can be heard by enemies.

This mod is server-sided meaning farts can be heard by other players.
Make sure everyone in the server has this mod installed for the best experience.

Default button is F, but it can be changed by modifying CheekSqueak's config file ("../BepInEx/config/CheekSqueak.cfg").

**Note:** This mod requires you to have BepInEx installed.
